This is a variation of the popular game Pac-Man and was created in Fall 2021. All of the code is in the language OCaml. In order to run the game, you must have OCaml installed on your machine. To play, type 'make build' and then 'make play' into your terminal. The directions to play the game are on the homescreen of the popup. Enjoy!
